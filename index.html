            <h1>Learn how to Play Bridge </h1>
            <p>Bridge is played with four people sitting at a card table using a standard deck of 52 cards (no jokers).
                The
                players across from each other form partnerships as North‑South and East‑West.</p>
            <p>Each deal consists of three parts – the auction, where the four players bid in a clockwise rotation
                describing
                their hands, the play, where the side that wins the bidding auction tries to take the tricks necessary
                to
                fulfill their contract, and scoring.</p>
            <p>Bidding is the language of bridge. Its purpose is to relay information about the strengths and weaknesses
                of
                each player’s hand to his partner.</p>
